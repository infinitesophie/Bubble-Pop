# Bubble-Pop
Bubble pop game 


The Game is developed for 1080x1920 resolution
- bubble with the same score merge and bump up the exponent by 1, e.g. 2x2 => 4, 3x2 => 8, 4x2 => 16, etc
- bubbles prefer to merge into a location where an automatic new merge is possible
- when the score reaches 2048 the bubble and its surroundings explode
- when a bubble or a cluster of bubbles is not connected to the ceiling, the whole cluster falls down


The Menu Scene is the first scene of the Game. There are two levels and more levels can be added by increasing the dificulty of the game.
